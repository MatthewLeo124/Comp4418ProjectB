In main branch:

1. line 8, unit
If 2 cases have same quantity and cost, the total sum is incorrect (less),
bcz same quantity and cost account for 1 stuff in #sum.
So we should not use anonyous variable here.
(But if accidently all parameters are the same, we need an unique ID) (consider if necessary)

2.
same things happen on line 34, line 47, line 48, with #sum and pick
if cost*quantity has identical value, the sum only account for once.

3.
It seem that it really has bug for multiple wanted.
maxPrice, totalPrice... should have the parameter NAME, otherwise chaos.
using the data:
part(pipe,m,30,70,usa).
part(pipe,s,36,90,usa).
part(gear,s,30,70,usa).
part(gear,s,36,90,usa).

wanted(pipe, 100000, 80).
wanted(gear, 100000, 80).
banned(australia).
